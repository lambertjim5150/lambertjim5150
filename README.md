## About me!
<img src="https://github.com/lambertjim5150/lambertjim5150/assets/172928529/41edab2e-5c4f-4f19-8756-74b5a61e0c4a" width="125" height="150">

Hi everyone! I'm Jim Lambert and I joined Liatrio on June 17, 2024. I am thrilled to be a part of this organization and hope that my experience and knowledge can help make the company and our clients even more successful. I am a lifelong learner and am constantly trying to expand my knowledge base. Over the years I've gone from being a developer to leading large global development organizations and am now wrapping up a Masters program in Organizational Psychology in July of 2024. I've been back in consulting since 2016 so I can leverage my 'battle scars', as well as everything I've learned and studied over the last 3 decades, to help clients understand what it truly takes to transform. 

I live in Colorado with my wife, Heather, and our 12 yr old dog, Pearl. My Daughter Emma is 24 yrs old and works for Dick's Sporting Goods and in addition to her management duties does visual design and art work. My son Spencer is 22 and looking to leverage his technical skills along with his musical skills to create a fully immersive gaming experience. 

## My First 90 Days
* I will be working with the leadership team on the Ignite Playbook and the Liatrio Delivery Methodology. 
* I will be working with one of our established clients and begin to build trusted advisor relationships with the folks there.

## Hobbies
- ðŸ“š: Reading
- ðŸ¥¾: Hiking
- âš¾: Baseball (NOT softball)
- â˜•: Coffee Snobbery 

## *Coffee Talk*, 1:1 Topics

Things I can talk about all day long... but are not everyone's cup of teaðŸ˜†

- Transformation - All things transformation, not just digital, but human.
- Ways of Working - Why I think what people THINK, FEEL, and BELIEVE is more important that process and technology
- Philosophy & Psychology - How they are inextricably linked, and potentially the bridge between the physical, metaphysical, and supernatural 

## My role and working style

My role and success as a leader, both internally and in client settings, is wholly dependent on making others successful. I will work incessantly to ensure others around me are heard, understood, supported, and given every opportunity to reach their greatest potential. It is when we create those experiences that magic truly happens.

## How to communicate
MyðŸšªis always open. Ping me, call me, schedule a Zoom meeting, whatever you want. Face to face is always my preference, but I'll take overcommunication via any means over the alternative ðŸ˜ƒ

## Strengths

- I am a huge advocate of CliftonStrengths, which is predicated on the idea that people are not problems to be solved but that each of us has unique combinations of gifts that allow us to provide value to others. 
- My personal strengths are Intellection, Input, Strategic, Connectedness, and Ideation. You can find their descriptions at https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253715/34-cliftonstrengths-themes.aspx

## Weaknesses

- I am just about as far on the Introvert side of the Extrovert/Introvert continuum as anyone can get. Being highly engaged, actively listening, and being empathetic is a huge part of my job, but energetically it is massively draining for me and requires a bit of solitude to recharge
- I get wrapped around the axle regarding the effective use of language for communication. It was something my grandmother instilled in me and it permeates the way I write and speak. It can be a gift, and a curse. 

## Book Recommendations

* [Tao Te Ching](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Te-Ching-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061142662). It is what I recommend when someone asks for a book on Servant Leadership
* [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469). Why eliminating distractions and entering a state of flow leads to the highest quality work.
* [The Hero With a Thousand Faces](https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Faces-Collected-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936). Yes, it's the basis for the Darth Vader story in Star Wars, but it is also the work that defined The Hero's Journey, and led the author to profoundly state "All religions are true but none are literal'.
